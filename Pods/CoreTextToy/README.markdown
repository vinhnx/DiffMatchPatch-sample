# CoreTextToy

This codebase implements CCoreTextLabel, a UILabel style class that supports attributed strings and simple HTML.

## Requirements

The master and develop branches require iOS 6.0 and higher with ARC.

IMPORTANT: iOS 5.x is supported in the “feature/iOS5” branch.

## Design

### CCoreTextLabel

A UILabel workalike that uses CoreText to render NSAttributedString objects. It supports most functionality that UILabel supports (including shadows).

This class is probably the primary reason you're using this codebase.

## CCoreTextLabel_HTMLExtensions

A very simple category on CCoreTextLabel that exposes a "markup" property. This property is a simple NSString that can contain HTML style markup. This is a "write-only" property (the getter only ever returns NULL).

### CCoreTextRenderer

The rendering class that takes NSAttributedStrings and some other parameters and renders them into the current CGContext. This class caches all the relevent information needed to render a certain string at a certain size. If the string or size changes the renderer object should be discarded and regenerated.

### CMarkupValueTransformer

A value transformer capable of converting _simple_ HTML into a NSAttributedString.

### UIFont_CoreTextExtensions

Extension on UIFont to get a CTFont and to get bold/italic, etc variations of the font. Scans the font name to work out the attributes of a particular font.

This code is crude and effective - but needs to be tested on _all_ iOS font names (especially the weirder ones).

## FAQ

### Why does this even exist? Why not just use UIWebView?

UIWebViews are expensive to create and are pretty much overkill when all you need is a simple UILabel type class that shows static styled text.

### Why does this even exist? Why not just use https://github.com/Cocoanetics/NSAttributedString-Additions-for-HTML

CCoreTextLabel is designed simply to show static text on screen, akin to UILabel. "NSAttributedString-Additions-for-HTML" seems to do a lot of things that I just dont need.

### How much HTML does this thing support?

It uses a minimal subset of HTML. In fact don't think of it as pure HTML - think of it as just a convenient method for creating NSAttributedString

Only a handful of tags are supported right now, but you can define your own quite easily.

Link and image tags are now supported.

The following tags are supported. More tags might be supported, see the source code for details.

* &lt;br&gt;
* &lt;b&gt;
* &lt;a&gt;
* &lt;i&gt;
* &lt;mark&gt;
* &lt;strike&gt;
* &lt;img&gt;

### So how do I get HTML into CCoreTextLabel?

The quick way:

    NSString *theMarkup = @"<b>Hello world</b>";
    NSError *theError = NULL;
    NSString *theAttributedString = [NSAttributedString attributedStringWithMarkup:theMarkup error:&theError];
    // Error checking goes here.
    theCoreTextLabel.markup = theMarkup;

The quicker way (if you want to use the CCoreTextLabel_HTMLExtensions category)

    NSString *theMarkup = @"<b>Hello world</b>";
    theCoreTextLabel.markup = theMarkup;

For the long way, see "How do I add custom styles?"

### How do I add custom styles?

    // Here's the markup we want to put into our. Note the custom <username> tag
    NSString *theMarkup = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"<username>%@</username> %@", theUsername, theBody];

    NSError *theError = NULL;

    // Create a transformer and give it a default font.
    CMarkupValueTransformer *theTransformer = [[CMarkupValueTransformer alloc] init];
    theTransformer.standardFont = [UIFont systemFontOfSize:13];

    // Create custom attributes for our new "username" tag
    NSDictionary *theAttributes = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
        (__bridge id)[UIColor blueColor].CGColor, (__bridge NSString *)kCTForegroundColorAttributeName,
        (__bridge id)[theTransformer.standardFont boldFont].CTFont, (__bridge NSString *)kCTFontAttributeName,
        NULL];
    [theTransformer addStyleHandlerWithAttributes:theAttributes forTagSet:[NSSet setWithObject:@"username"]];

    // Transform the markup into a NSAttributedString
    NSAttributedString *theAttributedString = [theTransformer transformedValue:theMarkup error:&theError];

    // Give the attributed string to the CCoreTextLabel.
    self.label.text = theAttributedString;
